# HardCamlYosys

Use the opensource verilog synthesis tool [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys)
to read a synthesizable verilog design, convert it to a structural netlist
and save it in a JSON file.

This library can read the JSON netlist file and reconstruct the design in HardCaml.

### Status

Early days, but simple test designs are working.  Working towards a big design like 
mor1kx before it's properly released.
